# Template strings:
Template strings or template literals is just another way to define strings in JavaScript. Instead of using single or double quotes like we normally use to define strings when we use template strings we use a backtick. You can use a backtick by pressing the key above your tilde key (the key above tab) to define a backtick.

Template strings allow you to add quotes or variables in your strings.

```jsx
 let name = "jhon";
 let age = 22;

 const intro = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`;
 console.log(intro)
```
