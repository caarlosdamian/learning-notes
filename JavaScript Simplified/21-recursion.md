# Recursion in JavaScript
Recursion is a function that can call itself. This can be confusing because at first glance it would look like that this would just create an infinite loop. Recursion can also cause the call stack to exceed the maximum number of calls allowed.

Recursion is used when you want to loop through objects using a function instead of a normal loop.
