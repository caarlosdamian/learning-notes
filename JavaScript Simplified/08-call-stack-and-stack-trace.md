# Call stack and Stack trace:
After learning about functions we will learn about debugging errors that are related to functions. We are going to do this using the call stack and the stack trace. When we write code we are going to run into errors eventually. The errors can be caused by a missing curly brace or incorrect logic whatever the case may be. When you run into an error in JavaScript it will be displayed in the console with red highlighting. If we click on the downwards pointing arrow it will show us the call stack. The call stack displays all the errors in your code line-wise in the console window. It works from the inside to the outside. It will also show the exact place the error is occurring.
