# Variables:
A variable is like a box, a box can store anything in it and it can be moved from one place to another and can also be given to others. It can have a name that can be used to reference it. For example, a variable named shoes can contain a list of all the shoes you own or the shoes that you want to buy. In JavaScript, we can use the following pre-defined keywords to create a variable which includes let, var, and const.

```jsx

let name = "Sam"

let age = 12

```

Variable names should be easy to read and understand and the first character of a variable name be an alphabet or a special character like the **@** sign. Variable names cannot be started by a number but can include them after the first character.
