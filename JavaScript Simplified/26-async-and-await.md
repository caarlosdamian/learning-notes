# Async and Await
To make asynchronous programming more easier JavaScript introduced async and await.
To use these features you will need a function and the async keyword comes before the function keyword.

```jsx
async function sum(){
 await // Your code here.
}
```

You can use a try-catch block to catch any type of errors that occur in your code.
