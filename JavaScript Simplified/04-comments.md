# Commenting your code:
Comments in programming are like giving instructions about a certain piece of code telling other developers or reminding yourself in the future how this particular piece of code works. In all of the above code snippets, the text starting with the double forward slashes(//) is a type of comment called a single line comment. You can also comment out multiple lines of code using a multi-line comment that starts with a forward slash and an asterisk symbol and ends with an asterisk symbol followed by a forward slash

```jsx

let a = "ABC" //This is a single-line comment b = "XYZ" /* This is how you can

add multiple line comments */

```
