# Short circuit evaluation
JavaScript is smart enough to do simple evaluations on its own. If you have an **OR** statement that is a boolean which takes true or false or it can take both values as true. JavaScript will stop the code at the first true value and will ignore everything else.

If, the first value is false then it will execute all of the code and print out both the false and true values.

This is known as short circuit evaluation.
