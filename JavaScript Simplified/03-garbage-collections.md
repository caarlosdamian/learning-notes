# Garbage collection:
A lot of modern programming languages have built-in garbage collection which is a great thing to have. Garbage collection is a process that removes unused variables from the memory. Itâ€™s a simple thing that is very useful when writing large-scale applications.

```jsx

let a = "abc"

console.log(a)

let b = "xyz"

console.log(b) //At this point the variable a does not exist in the memory.

```
