# How to declare Variables in JavaScript:
Before ES6 there was only one way to declare variables in JavaScript, that was by using the **var** keyword. ES6 introduced two new ways to declare variables in JavaScript called **let** and **const** making the total ways to declare a variable to three.

## Difference between var, let, and const:

### Var:
The var keyword was used before ES6 introduced let. The var keyword creates a variable that can be hoisted in the global scope and which is not recommended for most programs.

### let:
Variables created with the let keyword are same as those created with the var keyword but the only difference between them is that variables created with the let keyword cannot be hoisted in the global scope and only work inside their own scope.

### const:
Variables created with the const keyword are constant. You cannot change their values after it has been defined like you can reassign values to variables created with let. Other than this the const keyword is the same as let.
