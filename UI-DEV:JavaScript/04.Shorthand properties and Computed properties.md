## Shorthand properties and Method Names:
ES6 introduced two new features in JavaScript called the Shorthand properties and Method names which allow objects to be more concise. Its really not necessary but it makes your code look nice.

## Computed properties:
ES6 introduced a feature called computed properties, that essentially let you
**Have and expression be computed as a property name of an object.**
