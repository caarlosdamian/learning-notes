# Object destructuring:
ES2015 introduced a new feature in JavaScript called object destructuring. To understand destructuring we are going to look at the basics of JavaScript objects.

In JavaScript when working with objects you use the dot syntax to add or access data from a object one at a time. But if we want to add more than one piece of information to our object we use the template literal syntax to add them.

We can add multiple properties to our object at a time but we cannot access all of them at the same time. Destructuring changed this and made it possible to access all of the properties of our objects all at the same time(This is also applicable to functions.), this led to less code and more efficiency.

# Array destructuring:
We don't use array destructuring as much as object destructuring but it still is a very useful thing in certain circumstances. Array destructuring allows us to efficiently use the properties that are available inside our array. 

Destructuring allows us to filter out what exactly we want from an array or an object as well as setting default values for the properties that we need incase of any error.
