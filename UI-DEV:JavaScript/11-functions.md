# What is a function:
Functions in JavaScript or programming in general are like a machine. A washing machine is a great example of a function, you put in your laundry, washing powder and power it on and it gives you clean clothes. This process is same for a function, we pass in arguments and then we perform the required operations on them and then the function returns us the result. 

A function that receives another function as it's arguments is called a higher order function, and the function that is being passed as an argument is called a callback function.
