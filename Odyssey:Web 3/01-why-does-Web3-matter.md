# Why does Web 3.0 matter?
Web 3.0 is the new revolution in the programming world by what's wrong with the current web? (Web 2.0) The answer is **Trust.** Trust is something that is lacking in our current web services that we use on a daily-basis because we don't how BIG TECH companies store our data or what they do we it. (We actually do)

Hackers can steal your data from these service providers or worse they can sell all your personal data to governments, ad marketers, and anyone who pays the right price. Web 3.0 is a new ray of hope that promises to solve this problem. 

Every "transaction" in Web 3.0 or the block-chain can be seen by anyone that is on that block-chain. So this removes the factor of what's happening to my data. It also remove almost every single "middleman" that exists in Web 2.0.

If trust can be set by code, then people don’t have to rely on middlemen to get things done. They:

- Don’t have to trust banks to get paid
- Don’t have to trust lawyers to draft a contract
- Don’t have to trust social networks to make a living
