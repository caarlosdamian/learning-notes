# Web 1.0
The first version of the "Internet" has existed since the 80's. Those times were simple	for consumers and developers both. Not everyone was privileged enough to have a computer like our time and those who did only consumed static content or we can call it "Read-only content."

Social networks were very loose and only a few companies cared about the Internet and there were only a few "Internet companies" at that time.

# Web 2.0

Web 2.0 began in the 2000's era when computer and servers both saw an upgrade in hardware and developer skills also got upgraded and internet speeds got more faster. A lot of people think that Web 2.0 is the after-effect of the dot-com boom that happened in the early 2000's.

In Web 2.0 every person is both a creator and a consumer. Plenty of BIG TECH companies dominate Web 2.0 like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Twitter. These companies have access to almost all of our personal data and they can do whatever they want with.

Businesses that are built on Web 2.0 platform like Facebook, Amazon or Instagram is like creating your home on a rented piece of land. **You own the house but not the land.** 
You also need a separate identity or profile for each of the platforms that you use because every company wants your data and they don't play nicely when you ask them to share.

# Web 3.0
The "Internet" is still in... let's say in it's puberty, Because a lot of companies are still thinking of shifting towards Web 3.0 and the new ones that are focused on Web 3.0 are still in progress.

Ownership and trustless-ness is the biggest driving factor for Web 3.0 because Web 3.0 removes the "Middleman" and allows creators to earn fully from their content without paying any taxes or fees to "Service providers".

Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 which gave a huge boost to the move towards Web 3.0. Any type of service or product that is built to be "Web 3.0" has to adhere to the following principles: _open, decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable, trustless,_ and _permissionless_.

We are slowly seeing Web2 platforms think about what it means to start building products and services that fit within Web3, such as [Twitterâ€™s Bluesky Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3816729) which set out to make a decentralized standard for social media. As with the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, the shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is largely due to infrastructure advancement, but there will be a mindset shift for builders and developers as governance will be much more user-centered. With the removal of a middleman and data living on immutable infrastructure, there is no control over data thus no censorship and less risk of data loss.

Web 3.0 is gaining attention of consumers and developers faster than both Web 1.0 and 2.0 combined.
