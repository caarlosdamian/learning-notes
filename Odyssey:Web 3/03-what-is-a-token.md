# What is a Token?
>A token is a record of ownership of an asset.

In Web 3.0, token can be of two types: Fungible or non-fungible.

- Fungibe tokens are interchangeable (E.g, Paper currency, Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Non-fungible tokens or NFTs for short are unique and only a single or a limited number of them exists.

Let's say you're a CSGO player,The virtual money that you earn after each match is a fungible token and if you buy a skin for a gun or a knife, that skin is an NFT.
