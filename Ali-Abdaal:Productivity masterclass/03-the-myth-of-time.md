# The myth of time
There are three big myths about productivity and one of them is that I don't have enough to do all the things that I want. 

> Time is what we want most but what we use worst. ---- WILLIAM PENN

The myth about not having enough time is totally false because each of us has the same amount of time in any given day.(24 hours) What we chose to do with our time is what really matters.

Canceling plans, delaying going to the gym or watching Netflix instead of doing homework are all the things that we do with our time. This is because going out with friends or completing our homework is not a top priority for ourselves. We actively make the choice to not complete it and then panic at the last moments of the submission time.

Your time is in your control and you decide what to do with it. If you give a fat and obese person a thousand dollars every time he goes to the gym with you or give a college student a thousand dollars for completing their homework everyday you will see that they will do it without you even telling them (You would also go broke.) because exercising at the gym or getting good grades is not their top priority. Their top priority is the thousand dollars.

So the phrase "I don't have time" should be re-phrased to "I am actively choosing to do this (whatever it may be) with my time than that (the other option)"
