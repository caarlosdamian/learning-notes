# The Myth of Motivation
Motivation is a myth, When we have to study for an exam or a test. The thought "I should probably study for my test" comes into your mind. At some point, throughout your day you will start studying. We can think of it like a journey from a thought to an action.

The real "Productivity" is when this whole journey takes as less time as possible. This is where "Motivation" comes into the journey. Motivation is like a middle man in the journey. 

Motivation is the feeling of doing something. When you want to study for the exam you are getting motivation to study and get good grades. Motivation is a feeling you get when you want to do something, The more motivated you are the more work you will do.

Motivation is a feeling, If you relay on a "feeling" to help you live your life, my friend you're in for a surprise. Because feelings are temporary and unreliable. 

Your feelings can change any second and are affected by almost everything. You should just have a thought and just go to action without needing any motivation. This process of is called "Discipline." When you have discipline you can go directly from a thought to executing that thought in the real life.

If you have discipline you don't need motivation. Disciplining yourself to a certain task requires vast amounts of time and effort but it pays off well in the future. Don't think of your tasks as chores instead think of them as something fun. If you can have fun while doing the laundry or reading the book you can finish your task in the least amount of time.

You only need motivation for the things that are painful to start but have a great impact on our life in the future. (Cooking, gym, reading) Humans crave feedback. If we go the gym once and get a six pack abs you will automatically start going to the gym every single day because your brain will be addicted to the dopamine rush you get while you're at the gym.

> Motivation leads to success and success leads to motivation.

The reason you don't go to the gym everyday or eat healthy because the feedback loop for these things is too long and the brain doesn't get any immediate dopamine from doing them.

The more actions you perform the more output you will produce. To get rid of the myth of motivation you need to focus on two things. Actions and outputs.

There are two ways deal with actions, number one being make the process as much as enjoyable as possible. Listen to music, keep a score, or do anything that makes the process of completing an action fun and makes your brain release more dopamine.

The second thing to complete our actions more quicker is by making the result of us not completing the action more painful on ourselves. If you didn't submit an assignment or attend a meeting your teacher or boss will be mad at you.

To remove this bad habit from ourselves the easiest way is that we should put our money on the line. Give any amount that you're comfortable with to a person that you trust and tell him that he can use that money for himself if you don't complete your required action.

There are also two things that we can do to increase our output quantity. Firstly, As we have discussed above. We can shorten or feedback loop. the quicker we feel or see changes in our body or work the more motivated we will feel to do the required task.

Salience outcomes are the second thing that makes our outputs more effective because if we watch a youtuber's vlog giving us a tour of the University he is attending and we wanted to attend the same University we get inspired by watching him and we start daydreaming about ourselves attending the same University.
