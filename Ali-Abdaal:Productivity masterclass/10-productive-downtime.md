# Productive Downtime
Doing a 9-5 job or and managing a side-business is a very hard thing to do. Most people don't even think about doing a side-business at all. But, there are also people that are super-productive and have multiple side gigs and a full-time job and a family to take care of. 

How do people manage all that and still be not burned out? The main reason for that is those people are also productive in their downtime. Downtime is the is the time in your day when you're waiting for something. Be it your lunch at a diner or waiting for a report to be signed by your manager. Whenever you're waiting try to "focus" on your side-goal instead of browsing social media.

The two-minute tasks that can clutter up your schedule are a great example of tasks that you can complete in your downtime.
