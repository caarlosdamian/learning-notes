# The power of habits
Habits are an atomic particles that help you be productive and help in your self-development.

> If you can improve yourself 1% every day you'll be 37% better than last year.

The power of good habits is that we only need to make tiny little improvements in our routine and it will start pilling up and in the time-span of one or two years we will be a totally different person.

In our childhoods our parents made us brush our teeth twice everyday. Now, in our adulthood brushing teeth twice a day is in-graved in our memory it's something that we subconsciously do.

> It's hard to get started but once we start there's no stopping.

Changing habits is not about a temporary goal. (Its about drive, Its about power!) Habit forming is about changing our personality, our self-image.

When you'll create your own identity or self-image by your habits it will be very hard for you to skip a day and not perform that habit. (I'm a developer and if I don't code or read an article about programming every day I just feel bad from the inside.)

Productivity is a mindset. If you believe that you are a productive person you'll be one. If you think you're a failure you will live your whole life as a failure.
