# What is productivity
When the industrial revolution started productivity was the amount of product a factory, worker, or in a single day was being made. 

> Productivity = Amount of products being made / Hours taken

In modern times productivity is all about how much a single person can achieve in a single day. Or we can say that we can define a productive person by the amount of tasks he can complete in a single day.

# The productivity equation
The modern productivity equation is based upon how much work a single individual can do in the least amount of time.

Firstly, we must focus on being "productive" about things or tasks that really matter and not on stuff that is of less or no importance.  The more useful output we can get in the least amount of time the more productive we can be.

Secondly, The most important part of the productivity equation is the "Fun factor". The fun factor is a constant variable in the productivity equation. If you are having fun doing something which is important to you (Job, business, chores) you won't need any type of motivation and consistency you will automatically be willing to do the required task because you will enjoy doing it.

# The mental model
Being productive is not about what app or technique you use to be more productive. It's about how much productive you are using that app or technique. Everyone loves an app or method that promises to make their lives easier. The question is does it?..

Like the productivity equation the mental model is also very important. It's divided into three categories.

## 1. The pilot:
The pilot sets the course of the plane and figures out in what direction is the plane heading.

We should be in pilot mode when we first wake up in the morning and plan-out or day. Deciding If we should wear a blue or a yellow tie, scheduling meetings for the afternoon or planning a dinner with friends. When you're doing all these things you're in the pilot mode. You decide what course is the plane going to take. 

## 2. The plane:
The plane's job is to follow the orders of the pilot and not deviate. The plane should be able to take-off and land properly. 

You enter the plane mode as soon as you're done making your daily to-do list or scheduling all of your meetings for the day. And you just ride along the journey throughout the day.

## 3. The engineer
The engineer is the remaining 10 percent of your time when you make sure that your plane is going steadily and there aren't any hurdles along the way. The engineer keeps the system organized the way that the pilot intended it to be and makes sure that the plane has enough fuel to land safely at the end of the day.
