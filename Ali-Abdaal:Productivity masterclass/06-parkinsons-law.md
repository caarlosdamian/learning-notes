# Parkinson's Law
Parkinson's law states that work expands the time that we allocate to it. If we an assignment due tomorrow we will complete it tonight. If we have a due date of three months from now we can easily complete it tonight and enjoy the next three months but we will still enjoy the three months time period with a worry in the back of our minds to complete the assignment and will panic the night before the due date.

Parkinson's law can help us boost our productivity if we assign ourselves "artificial" deadlines. Complete an assignment today whose deadline is next week. By doing this we are generating more useful output in the least amount of time.
