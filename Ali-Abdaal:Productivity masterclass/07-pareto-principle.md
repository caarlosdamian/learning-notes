# Pareto principle
According to the pareto principle 80 percent of the results will come from the 20 percent effort that you put in your work.

The pareto principle blends into productivity easily because if you are studying for an upcoming test it's a proven fact that 80 percent of the test questions will come from the 20 percent of the syllabus which is the core part of that subject.

You can pass your exam if you only apply 20 percent of your effort on studying and probably get good grades but you need to figure out the most core/important topics that you need to study to get passing marks.
