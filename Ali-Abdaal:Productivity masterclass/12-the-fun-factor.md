# The fun factor
If you're not enjoying the things that you have chosen to base your life around then stop and rethink your choices. If you're not enjoying the short term situations in your life than you wont enjoy the rest of your life.

If you don't enjoy your School/University life and think that getting a job will be better than this than you're doing wrong to yourself. Most jobs don't require a degree. Freeze your semester and try doing a job. 

When you're an employee at a high-value company you will struggle and always keep reminding yourself that once I get a promotion my life will be set. After that promotion you will want to become the boss and after that the CEO.

If you don't enjoy the process of doing whatever is that you choose. You will never "Fully" enjoy the end.
