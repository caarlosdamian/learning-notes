# Vast amounts of knowledge and Soft skills
A programmer who has been in the industry for over 3 years has gained a vast amount of knowledge and experience. When he has to solve a technical problem that vast amount of knowledge is what he relies on the most. 

When he needs to attend a meeting or collaborate with other team members on the project he's working on he will require a vast amount of "soft skills". 
soft skills are basically the ability to communicate well with others, leading the team, showing empathy, collaborate effectively with other team members and managers, handling pressure, meeting deadlines, handling uncertainty and emotional situations.

> Soft skills are required in every field.
