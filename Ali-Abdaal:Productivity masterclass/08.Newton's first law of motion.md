# Newton's first law of motion
Newton's first law of motion states that: An object will stay at rest or travel at a constant velocity until a external forced is applied on it.

This law can also be applied to productivity. If we are laying in our bed procrastinating we will continue to procrastinate until something important (external force) comes up. Or if we are doing something slowly we will only start working faster when the deadline comes near.

We don't want to do things that are painful in the beginning  and fruitful in the long-term.  We just need that "push" that will turn our thought into an action. 

The two-minute rule states that if a task takes less than two-minutes to complete you should do it now instead of thinking you'll do it when the time comes. If you let these tiny little tasks pile up they'll turn into a mountain before you even know it.

The five-minute rule states that if you have a task that you don't want to complete but have to do. (Assignment, meeting, etc..) Just do it for 5-minutes. This tricks our brain into doing that task. The more you work on your assignment the more quickly you'll enter your flow state.
