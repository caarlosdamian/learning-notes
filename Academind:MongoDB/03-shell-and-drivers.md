# Shell and Drivers
The MongoDB shell is the command-line interface to interact with your database and MongoDB also provides drivers for most programming languages that you can use to interact with the MongoDB database with your application that you have made in your preferred programming language.

The drivers work like bridges between your app and the MongoDB database. The commands that you use in the shell remain the same their just adjusted to the syntax of the programming language you choose.
