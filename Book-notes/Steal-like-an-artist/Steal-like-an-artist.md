### Advice

- The author presents the theory of advice, that when someone gives you any kind of advice it means that they want to share their experience with their past selves.

### Worth it    

- Most creative persons get this question asked a lot and that question is **Where do you get your ideas from?** Each person will give you his version of his answer but in honesty we just steal them.

- If you like something, steal it. If you don't then keep looking.

### Nothing is original

- Nine out of ten times when a person tells you that something is original they just don't know the original source or reference.
- We should not try to re-invent the wheel bu instead try to create a more improved version of it.
- If we look closely, each new idea or invention is just mix-up of previous ideas and inventions.
- You should only collect selected ideas that inspire you and not hoard every single idea that you come across.
- Find a mentor, and focus on him and not his work then find three people that your mentor follows and start following them repeat this cycle until you become a mentor.

### Read deeply

- As a creative you have to be a very curious person, find things that inspire you. Google everything before you ask someone, read more books.

### Save your thefts

- Carry a notebook and a pen or have a notepad application on your smartphone to jot down things that you observe and your thoughts.
- Capture everything that interests you and save it for later when you run out of ideas.

### What are we

- "Impostor syndrome" It is a condition that is found in almost all of the greatest minds. This is a condition in which you feel like you are not worth it, you are not ready yet. The truth is no one will know when they will be ready or when will they be able to learn something.
- The best way to overcome this is by start doing the work and figuring out things along the way.

### Fake it

- Just start pretending to do something until you finally finish doing it.
- All of the world is your stage. Dress like who you wanna become, sit and talk with people that inspire you.

### Start copying

- Your own unique style of work will develop when you copy others. Keep copying different people and then mix the aspects of each that you like the most. - That is your own style.
- Don't steal others work and say that you made it. Steal it and the reverse-engineer it to make it look like you made it from scratch. - You will also learn all the ins-and-outs of the other persons work.
- Find who you want to copy from, then find out what you want to copy from them.
- Humans cannot copy something 100% perfectly, there will always be flaws in it.

### Write what you like

- Write about the things that you like. If you read a book or watched a movie and there was something that you didn't like write about that. Create you own story and steal the characters. - This is called fan-fiction.
- Do the work, create the things that **you like** change the narrative of a story, create a sequel, or maybe change the genre? Do the things that you like.

### Step away

- You won't get any inspiration from just sitting around in-front of your computer screen. Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty.
- If you do all of your work in a computer you won't be able to feel how this works or be able to learn what happens behind the screen.
- Go out, have a picnic, get together with old friends, walk your dog. Doing stuff with your own hands will inspire you more than you could ever think of.

### Productive procrastination

- Creating side-projects is very important. Sometimes magic happens even in the smallest of pieces of art.
- Bounce between different projects so that you don't get bored. If you do, start a new one.

### Go outside

- Take some time just wonder, do boring tasks because you can't always be working on something.
-  A creative person needs time to be bored so that he find extraordinary things in the ordinary things.
- If you have more than one real passion don't discard any of them. Instead keep following all of them and soon they'll be connected together.

### Good work

- If people haven't discovered your talent yet you have complete freedom to refine that talent as much as possible.
- Once you start sharing your work with others and people start paying attention to your work you won't have that freedom because people will expect only the very best from you.

### Share your dots

- Create a Twitter profile, start a blog, or a YouTube channel start telling your secrets. but don't tell every single detail about them.
-  Share a useful tip, a interesting article, a book that you've read. You have full control over how much about these things that you wanna share.

### Your own world

- In the modern world we are connected with each other 24/7. In-fact, you can even connect with total strangers from around the world.
- Build your own community of like minded people so that they can inspire you and you can inspire them.  
- You are **Connected 24/7** this may sound like a great idea but sometimes you just need a moment of peace and quite. Complete solitude from the online world and just enjoy the world around you.

### Be uncomfortable

- Doing work in you home-office is a great thing but sometimes it's better to go out in the wild and discover a new place with new people. 
- The more you start being comfortable in newer surroundings the more creative ideas you will come up with.
- **But where should I go?** The answer is simple. Go to a new park, a new library, or just stroll around your own street.

### Take care

- You need to take care of yourself. Eat healthy, workout, socialize, and do stuff that makes you happy.
- You won't be alive forever, make the most of your time doing the things you love and make sure that the things you do leave a positive impact on the world.
- Save money, don't fall for the latest trends, or the newest gadgets when your old ones are perfectly fine.  
- Always find time for your side projects and hobbies. Even if you work a full-time job there are moments in your day where you can find the time for a little bit of creativity on the side.
