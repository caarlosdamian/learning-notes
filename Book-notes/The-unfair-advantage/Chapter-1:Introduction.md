### How to be successful

- To be successful in the startup world you should use every advantage that is available to you instead of just focusing on one thing.
- Competitive advantages or an "Unfair Advantage" can be anything. You reached class early, you learned about the topic beforehand, or almost anything that you can think of.
- There are going to be some advantages that only you'll or your friend will have. Those are called natural talents.
- Keep in mind, don't use any illegal means like cheating or bribery and call it an advantage because that  is an unethical practice and is not recommended.
