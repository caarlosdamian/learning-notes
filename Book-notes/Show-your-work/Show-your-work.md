### Be so good they can't ignore you.

- Forget about promoting your content. If it's good people will notice it automatically.
- Be **Find-able.** This means try to become so good at your work that everyone starts discovering your work on their own.
- Try to be the best at what you do. Share small details about your life but don't brag about it.

### Don't be a genius

- There isn't a great mind in the world who are regarded as geniuses worked together with a group of like minded individuals helping and supporting each other.
- Creativity happens when great minds think alike.
- You don't need to be a genius in today's world to be creative. Connect with people that are better than you in your field and learn from them while trying to contribute to the work they are doing.
- In the time where everything is connected via the internet you or any other person can contribute to anything they want.

### Be an amateur

- An amateur is a person who is knows more than a beginner and less than a master. Being an amateur in today's world is a good thing.
- Take chances, try out new things, listen to your gut.
- Our world is changing every single minute being a master in one field is not the best thing because it can become irrelevant in a matter of days.

### Learn in public

- Start learning a new skill and tell every single person that you can, write blog posts about what you learned today, find an online forum and chat with people learning the same thing.
- In our time if your work is not available online, It doesn't exist.

### Behind the scenes

- Most of your audience won't be interested in your daily routine. How you manage to find inspiration and what is your process to create a product. They just want to look at the finished product and not the details of how you made it.
- There will be a few people that will want to know every single detail in full because they are so impressed by your work that they want to steal your secrets.
- Documenting your day-to-day activities is one of the best ways to show your work. 

### Build a good name for yourself

- Create a online website of your own. It's the place where all of your ideas and thoughts will live.
- Don't worry about making a bunch of money or being successful once you start doing good work and when people start to notice you, your name will be your own currency.

### First learn then teach.

- If you think you are good at something, try teaching someone. You will share your experience and the student will share his.
- Teach your secrets and techniques specially if you're self-thought and warn the students about the mistakes that you made.

### Learn to take a punch.

- A creative person's best quality should be that he should be able to take a punch. Meaning that he should be able to handle all types of criticism positively.
- The more good work you put out the more people you will attract, some will like your work some won't and some will genuinely give guidance about improving your work.

### Don't quit.

- Life is full of ups and downs. You will have to learn to live with them if you want do fulfill your dreams.
- Quitting pre-maturely or just because you aren't doing well isn't a great excuse to throw away whatever  you've accomplished in your life.
- Like a chain-smoker lights a cigarette before the current one finishes you should also start thinking about your next project before your current one finishes.
