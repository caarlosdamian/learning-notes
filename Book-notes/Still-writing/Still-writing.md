### Our stories 
- Sometimes we may think that weâ€™re in charge, or that we have things figured out.
- Things in life don't always go as planned. Sometimes we are at the top of the world and it only takes a few moments to fall down to ground. When this happens you must have the courage to stand back up and climb again to reach the top.
- The stories that make up your life, you don't choose them they choose you.

### Flow state

- Think of the flow state as waves of the ocean.  If you can harness the power of these waves to help you learn, write, or do what you wanna do instead of the wave overpowering you and taking you along with it.(means procrastinating on)

### Inner censor

- Treat your inner censor or Impostor syndrome in my case as a frenemy rather than someone who controls your whole life.
- Impostor syndrome is something that will take many forms and shapes to get you to think low about yourself and feel bad.  
- Once you've entered the flow state,  It affect you anymore. It will be powerless in when you are in your flow state.

### Start small

- Start small, don't think that a million dollar startup idea can be made in just an hour.It takes a lot of time to learn and build it. Find a small problem in a bigger one and try to solve it first.
- Breakdown your bigger problems into smaller ones, Everyone starts some where, practice by creating small projects that are bad and do only a simple function.
- Keep practicing, Eventually these small bad projects will combine into one amazing project.
- You'll always find a creative person practicing, and only practicing.

### Special place

- Every writer needs a place which will his triggers his flow state. 
- You'll have to find your own special place. It will be different for everyone, some like solitude, some go outside, some even ride public transport but once you're in your flow state nothing will matter anymore.

### Daily routine

- Your story is the sum of all that has happened to you in real life. If your history is not a story that can be told then you haven't lived life. 
- Waking up, eating breakfast, going to work your daily routine is your story. It's not about how mundane it may be it's about how you tell others about it.

### Practice daily

- Have a bulletin board in your room to quickly tackle down ideas and inspirations.
- Complete your work then browse social media or you will be lost in it for the entire day.
- Sit down daily and just work. It doesn't need to be your greatest work but just ordinary work that you do daily and one day it will turn into your greatest work.

### Uniqueness

- You are unique, every thought, every expression of you is unique. The world may not notice this but it is your responsibility to know how much valuable you are.
- A creative mind can never be satisfied. It will always be looking for the big thing which makes him different from others.
- Sometimes you just have to get lost in your work. Move away from our friends and family and start living in the world that we created.

### Over excitement

 - Don't get too much excited over anything. Try to limit your brain to things that matter the most. 
 - When your working the outside world feels a new toy and you feel like a baby. You just want that new toy.
 - Don't get distracted by the outside world or what is happening in the world, This way you'll lose focus over your work and sometimes even forget what you were working on.

### Competition

- Your only competition is yourself, not another person. Try to get better each day.
- Wake up each day like you've been given a new opportunity to finish your work or start something new. 

### Time

- Protect your time, feed your soul with good food. Avoid any thing that disturbs you,try reading books, listen to a podcast from a person that you follow..
- Try to be in solitude as often as you can. Walk, stop using your phone, Only handle work related queries during your working hours.
