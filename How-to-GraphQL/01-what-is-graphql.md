# What is GraphQL:
GraphQL is a new way to create APIs that are more powerful, efficient, and flexible than REST. GraphQL is developed by Facebook and was open-sourced in 2015 and is now maintained by a large community of developers.

GraphQL allows *declarative* data fetching, clients specify what exactly they want from the server and GraphQL returns the required data, from a *single endpoint* instead of exposing multiple endpoints as a REST API would.

## A query language for APIs:
Modern applications today need to access servers to store and retrieve data from them, this process is the responsibility of the APIs to provide an *interface* to store and retrieve data from the servers.

Most people assume that GraphQL is a database technology, which is not correct. GraphQL is a query language for APIs.  GraphQL doesn't have any specific requirements it can be used anywhere where an API is required.
