# Efficient alternative to REST:
before GraphQL, REST was the default way to expose data from a server because applications were simple and the development ecosystem wasn't that developed that much as it is today. But in the last couple of years, the API landscape has changed and is still changing rapidly, three factors challenge the way APIs are made today.

## Increased mobile usage:
Increased mobile usage, low-powered devices, and unstable networks are the main reasons Facebook created GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.

## Frontend frameworks and platforms:
The heterogeneous landscape of frontend frameworks and platforms that run client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access precisely the data it needs.

## Fast feature development:
More users mean more data being consumed, and each one of these users requires fast access to the data that they request from the server. GraphQL plays a vital role here because it only retrieves the specific data that each user requests. 

## Context and Adoption:
Facebook created GraphQL to use in their native mobile apps and open-sourced it in 2015. It is now primarily used in web apps but can also be used in mobile application development. GraphQL was introduced at the React.js conference in 2015 because Facebook used it in react.js most developers thought that it can be only used in react.js but GraphQL is an open-sourced technology and can be used in almost in tech-stack.

## Rapidly growing community:
Being open-sourced GraphQL was quickly adopted by most major programming languages and the fact that Netflix and Coursera also tried to make their own alternatives to GraphQL, Netflix created falcor which it uses in its apps and Coursera just used GraphQL in the end.

GraphQL is used by many companies today such as GitHub, Twitter, and many more.
