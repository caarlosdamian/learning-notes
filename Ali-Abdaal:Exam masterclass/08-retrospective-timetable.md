# Retrospective timetable

A retrospective table table doesn't follow the principle of  planning in advance for the topics that you need to study for instead you use the topics as the main factor of creating your timetable.

In a retrospective timetable  the topics are your main focus and you will note down the date against the name of the topic that you studied for instead of planning in advance for the topics and days.

You can track your progress by color coding the dates that you study the topic on.  When you are comfortable with a topic you cam highlight it in green.
