# Create a Syllabus
It doesn't matter what subject you're learning. The only thing matters that how you learn it. If you don't have a syllabus or road-map for learning you will end up being counter-productive. 

Create a syllabus for yourself, create a guideline, research about MOOC's and limit yourself from trying to learn everything that is available to you. Only pick the materials and instructors that you think you can learn the best from.

Each teacher has his own way to teach and each student has his own way of learning, Keeping that in mind conduct research about different teachers and materials and then craft your own syllabus from the materials.
