# Feynman technique
The Feynman technique says that in order for you to fully understand a topic you must be able to teach that topic to your friends or a five year old child. 

This technique was named after the great physicist Richard Feynman who was known for his contribution in making physics easier so that even an ordinary person can understand it.

He did this by learning enough about physics that he was able to explain the concepts to almost anyone. 

If you explain a topic to another person or a child, they will ask you questions about why do we this and not that? If you can answer those questions you've mastered that topic because you can answer questions related to that topic. If you can't, try revising your notes or source materials or try asking your teacher or google about the question that was asked to you.

In short, the Feynman technique says that in order to learn something you must fully understand it then be able to explain it to others.
