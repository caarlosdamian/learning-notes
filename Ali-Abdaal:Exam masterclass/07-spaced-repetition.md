# Spaced repetition
There is a time limit to how long you can remember a certain topic. There will be a time where you will forget what you learned today.

The solution to this problem is called spaced repetition. If you keep repeating the topic after a specified interval it will take more time for you to forget that knowledge.

Decay of knowledge is inevitable because your brain can only store a finite amount of knowledge at a given time. But by constantly remembering the topic that you want to learn can help you memorized it in the long term.
