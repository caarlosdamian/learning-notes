# Scoping the subject
Whenever you start studying about a new subject go through all of the topics of that subject and understand how the topics connect to each other.

This is known as scoping the subject, where you get a birds eye view of all the topics of the subject. The subject is like a tree and the topics are like branches if you know where the branches are coming from then you can understand them more clearly.
