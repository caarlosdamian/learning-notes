# Take notes after class
You can't note down everything that the lecturer explains in a class. You should review your notes after class to get an idea of what you learned and then apply the Feynman technique to these notes to understand the topic.

You made need to redo everything from scratch sometimes. But the end goal should be to understand a topic so well that you can explain it to a five year old.
