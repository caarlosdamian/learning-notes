## Spread and Rest Operators
The rest parameter is written like this:  ``...numbs``  It is three dots followed by a name. This takes all of the arguments of the functions and bundles them into a single array parameter.

The spread operator is used to spread out array values. It is defined the same way as the rest operator.


## Sets
Sets are a new data structure in the object types. Introduced in ES6, sets are like arrays but they don't allow storing duplicate values in them each value must be unique. 

## Symbols
Symbols are a new data type released in the ES6 update to JavaScript. The unique feature of symbols is that each symbol is unique and two symbols cannot have the same value.

Symbols are a great way to define keys in objects.
