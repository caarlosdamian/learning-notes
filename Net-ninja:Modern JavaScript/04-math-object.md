# Math Object
Objects are the building blocks of JavaScript. Most of the code that we write in JavaScript is object-oriented.

You can create your own objects for almost any function that you want your code to perform but for ease-of-use JavaScript provides many built-in objects such as the math object.

The Math object starts with a capital m and allows us to perform mathematical operations on or code.

```js

 console.log(Math);
 console.log(Math.PI);

```

The above code snippet will print out all of the methods available in the math object and the second line will print out the value of Pi which is a mathematical constant.

Notice that we are using dot notation when accessing the Pi method from the math object.

There are many more built-in methods in the math object such as round, ceil, area, and random.
