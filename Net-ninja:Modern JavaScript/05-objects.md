# Objects
The best way to understand objects in JavaScript is that you compare them real life objects.

A mobile phone has both properties and methods. It's color and features are the properties and making a call or taking a picture are the phone's methods.

Objects in JavaScript also perform the same way. They also have properties and methods. JavaScript also has some built-in objects like the date and math object.
