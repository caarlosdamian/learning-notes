# ERC-721
ERC-721 is the first standard for NFTs on Ethereum. Its like a template for building smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It provides all of the guidelines that you need to create your NFTs

This standard creates and keeps track of ownership of NFTs. 

# ERC-1155
The last standard on the Ethereum network is called ERC-1155. This standard is like an enhancement to the ERC-721 standard.

ERC-1155 is an super-set of the ERC-721 standard because it can hold classes and is a lot cheaper. You can also trade in bulk and also create ERC-721 tokens in an ERC-1155 token.
