# Block-chain and NFTs
NFTs are a concept of a token that acts like a proof of ownership of an digital asset. In the real world, The concept of NFTs is powered by de-centralized block-chains. The block-chain is the backbone of the NFTs

A block-chain is a type of a database that consists to multiple pieces and copies so that each person that is a member of the block-chain has his own personal copy of the database.

There are many advantages to using block-chains. It provides us with the options of:

- Inter-operability
- Trade-ability
- Immutability
- Liquidity
- Program-ability

## Inter-operability
NFTs have the ability to be exchanged across eco-systems. The actual NFT is just a token. If that token is created on the Ethereum block-chain it can be exchanged on any block-chain that is based on the Ethereum block-chain and marketplaces. 

## Immutability
An NFT should be unique and in-divisible. An asset can have multiple copies of it on the block-chain but each individual unit has a unique serial number or code that makes it different from others. They make look the same but in reality they are all unique.

Block-chains records data in a way that makes it very hard for us to change it.

## Trade-ability
An NFT can be freely traded on any compatible marketplace or block-chain. An NFT can be traded across ecosystems, for example if I have an asset on the Ethereum block-chain and want to trade it for another asset on a block-chain that is compatible with Ethereum I can easily trade it.

## Liquidity
Liquidity means that I can sell my NFts on marketplaces that will give me cash or bitcoin or ethereum instead of another digital asset of the same value.

## Program-ability
NFTs also need to support the ability to hold code inside of them. We can program NFTs that will allow us to execute certain tasks at a certain period of time.
