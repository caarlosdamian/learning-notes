# Why do we need NFTs
In the digital world, the ownership of an asset was never clearly defined. When you buy something online you and the people that you tell are the only one who knows that you bought that asset. The public doesn't know. 

Ownership of an asset means that you can re-sell it freely. Currently we don't have any standard way to re-sell online assets.  What proof do you have publicly that the asset that you claim is actually your?

These are the types of questions and scenarios that NFTs as a technology is trying to solve. Each NFT is a unique online asset that cannot be copied or replaced because the proof of ownership is available publicly online on a de-centralized ledger called the block-chain.
