# Fungible versus non-fungible
A fungible token or asset is equal to 1:1. A single US dollar is only equal to another US dollar regardless of when it was printed or it's serial number. If the asset can be changed in value and in likeness it is considered fungible. Bitcoin also is an example of a fungible token or asset.

Examples of non-fungible tokens can be a plane ticket, a watch, and a collection of stamps or figurines. 

A Rolex watch is sometime worth millions of dollars no matter how old it is.(Sometimes the older ones cost more.) And a regular watch that you buy from a local store is worth only it's price and it's value will only decrease and not increase as time goes by like the Rolex. The serial code and model of the Rolex also matters because the more unique the watch will be the more valuable it will be.

Two Rolex watches of the same model, one made in 1950 and one made in 2020 have different values because the older model has a higher value that the  community of watch collectors have given it. The value of the asset determines that is it a fungible asset or a non-fungible asset.

For something to be a non-fungible asset it has have three criteria:

- It has to be unique.
- Irreplaceable
- Non-interchangeable.

> The value of an item and its use determines whether it is fungible or non-fungible.
