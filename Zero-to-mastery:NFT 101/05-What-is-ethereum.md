# What is Ethereum
Ethereum powers NFTs. The Ethereum block-chain is where almost all of the NFTs are available. Ethereum itself is just a digital currency but it can be programmed to do almost anything that you want with it.

Ethereum powers a lot of different things and is a lot of different things. You can send and receive money, build de-centralized apps, create marketplaces on top of it. 

Ethereum acts like a burner fuel for the things that you want to accomplish on the block-chain. Ethereum is a programmable block-chain. It allows you take code and deploy it on the Ethereum network. 

There is a whole standard and process for deploying code on the Ethereum platform. You cannot just deploy any code that you write.
