# Block-chain:distributed
Each block-chain is equally distributed among all of the users and each user has a full copy real-time copy of the whole block-chain.

Sometimes a computer may or may not agree to all of the rules that regulate the block-chain and keeping track of all of the members in the block-chain can be a very hard task. The solution to this problem is a distributed consensus.

A consensus is a agreement about the block-chain that is agreed by all of the members. If we add a new block in the block-chain at least 51% of the members will have to agree so that the new block could be added to block-chain.

This rule also applies to previous members. If a previous member acts suspicious or tries to do something malicious and 51% percent of the members agree to ban them they will be banned from the block-chain completely.
