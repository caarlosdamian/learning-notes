# Block-chain:Immutability
A block-chain is the building blocks(pun intended) of the Web 3.0. A block-chain consists of multiple blocks and acts like a database that records transactions.

Each block has three things inside it. It has some data that we have stored in it, It has a unique hash value that is used to identify it and the hash value changes every time the data is changed and the final thing that the block has the hash value of the previous block that was created before it. This allows the blocks to be chained together hence the name block-chain. 

The first block in every block-chain is called the genesis block because it doesn't have any other previous blocks and all other blocks originate from it.
