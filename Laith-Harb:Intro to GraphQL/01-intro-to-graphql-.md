# What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language which gives the client to ask for exactly what they need from the server.

## A real life use-case
If you are a car salesman and someone comes to your store to purchase a car from you. The company you want to work for has policy that you can only sell cars to people that are a citizen of the country and they have a high credit score.

You open your computer and find out about the details of the customer and it displays all the personal data about the customer. We only need to check his citizenship and credit score we don't care about who is wife his or how many children he has or where he lives.

The computer result gives a lot of unwanted information. The company that made the software to check the information about the customers were told of this problem and then they implemented a drop-down function in their software that allows you to check only the required details about a particular customer.

The drop-down is GraphQL in a nut shell.
