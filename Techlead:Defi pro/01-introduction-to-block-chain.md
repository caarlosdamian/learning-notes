# Introduction to Block chain
A block chain is a public list of transactions. Like a public ledger, It records all of the transactions that happen in the block chain and is protected by a group of distributed computers. All of the members in the block chain agree on the transactions. 

In short form a block chain is just a list of transactions that can be seen by all of the people that are members of the block chain. 

# Smart contract
After Bitcoin people thought why not have a public list of  other things as well. 

A smart contract is basically a piece of code that can store funds inside of it. Ethereum which is a very popular block chain allows you to use smart contracts. So ethereum is just a list of smart contracts.

# Meta mask
You will need a digital wallet to store and receive funds on the block chain and the most popular digital wallet currently is Meta mask. It can be added as a browser extension.

# Ethereum virtual machine and gas
After Ethereum became more and more popular and the amount of transactions happening on the Ethereum block chain increased they introduced a small fees (300$) called gas which is applicable when you send funds to someone on the Ethereum block chain. You can receive funds for free though.

Then, people started creating their own block chains based on Ethereum which are 100% compatible with the Ethereum block chain using the Ethereum virtual machine or EVM for short.

These new and smaller block chains provided more yield and required lesser gas which became the reason for their popularity and these smaller block chains are where most of the DeFi happens.
