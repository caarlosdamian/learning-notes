# What is DeFi
You can think of decentralized finance as anything that crypto-currencies can do.

The famous crypto currencies Bitcoin and DOGECoin are not DeFi because they are on block chains that don't support smart-contracts. You can only buy and sell both Bitcoin and DOGECoin and nothing else.

Ethereum is a  crypto currency that supports smart contracts. These smart contracts allow you to do almost anything with Ethereum. Smart contracts have their own wallets and you can store Ethereum in them.

Liquidity is the most important factor in DeFi. Liquidity is the ability to exchange assets.

DeFi is a rapidly changing field and it can be used for pretty much anything related to crypto currencies. 

There are other block chains rather than Ethereum that have a low gas price such as Avalanche, Chronos, and Phantom block chain have better yields.
